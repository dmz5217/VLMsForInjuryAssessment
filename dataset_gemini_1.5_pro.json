                "severe_hemorrhage": "The scene depicts a person lying on the ground inside a caged sports area, possibly a soccer or lacrosse field.  They are wearing a baseball cap and what appears to be a light-colored shirt and dark pants.  Their legs are obscured by the netting.  There appears to be blood on their shirt and potentially on the ground near them.\n\nThe person appears to be bleeding, and the presence of blood indicates a possible injury. Whether the bleeding qualifies as \"severe hemorrhage\" is difficult to definitively say from the image alone. While there's definitely blood present, the image doesn't clearly show the rate of bleeding or any amputations. The amount of blood visible, while concerning, doesn't automatically translate to a life-threatening hemorrhage based just on this picture. More information would be needed to assess the severity of the situation.\n",
