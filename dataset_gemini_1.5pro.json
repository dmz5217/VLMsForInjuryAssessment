                "scene": "The scene depicts a life-sized dummy dressed in a U.S. military camouflage uniform, lying on the grass inside a fenced area. It appears to be a training or demonstration scenario.\n\nThe dummy is wearing a helmet and sunglasses. Its right arm has a simulated wound with exposed \"flesh\" visible. Its legs are splayed out in front of it, with yellow work boots on its feet. \n\nBeside the dummy is a white cube with a QR code on the front and the number \"9\" beneath it. The background shows a chain-link fence, part of a brick building (possibly a factory with \"INCUBATIO\" visible on the sign), trees, and a clear blue sky. Some dry leaves are scattered on the grass.\n\nThe dummy is clearly not a real person but is posed to represent a casualty in some sort of exercise, possibly related to battlefield medicine or casualty evacuation training.\n",
                "trauma_head": "The scene depicts a male mannequin dressed in camouflage military fatigues, lying on the ground in what appears to be a grassy area within a fenced-in field.  A white box with a QR code and the number \"9\" printed on it sits beside the figure.  The background includes a chain-link fence, parts of a building, trees, and a clear blue sky.\n\nThe mannequin appears to have a simulated wound on its left arm, showing exposed stuffing or padding beneath the torn fabric.  \n\nThere are no clear signs of head injuries on the mannequin.  While the mannequin is wearing what appears to be a helmet or protective headgear, there's no visible damage to the head or helmet itself.  It's important to remember that this is a mannequin, and any apparent injuries are simulated.\n",
                "trauma_torso": "The scene depicts a male mannequin dressed in camouflage military attire, resembling a casualty. He is situated on the ground, leaning back against a chain-link fence in what appears to be a grassy field. A white cube with a QR code and the number 9 is placed near the mannequin's right side.\u00a0 The background includes part of a brick industrial building and trees.\n\nThe mannequin has a simulated injury to his left arm, where the fabric is torn and a reddish material suggests a wound. There is also a dark stain on the mannequin's left torso, likely another simulated injury, although the specific type is unclear. It could represent a gunshot wound, shrapnel injury, or other trauma.\n\nThe mannequin is wearing sunglasses and a helmet. Its pose and the presence of the \"wounds\" clearly create the impression of a combat casualty scenario, possibly for training purposes given the QR code's proximity.\n",
                "trauma_lower_ext": "The scene depicts a male mannequin dressed in camouflage military fatigues, seated on the ground within a fenced area. He's wearing a helmet and sunglasses. To his right is a white cube with a QR code and the number \"9\" on it. The background includes a chain-link fence, a building with the partially visible word \"INNOVATION,\" trees, and a clear blue sky. The ground is covered with grass and scattered leaves.\n\nThe mannequin has a significant injury to his left leg. The camouflage fabric is torn away, revealing an exposed, artificial \"bone\" and internal structure. This appears to simulate a severe open fracture or traumatic amputation.\u00a0There are no apparent injuries to his right leg. \n\nThe mannequin's overall appearance suggests a training scenario for first responders or military personnel, perhaps practicing trauma assessment and treatment in the field.  The QR code could potentially link to information about the simulated scenario or the mannequin's injuries.\n",
                "trauma_upper_ext": "The scene depicts a male mannequin dressed in camouflage military fatigues, wearing a helmet and sunglasses, sitting on the grass within a fenced-in area. A white cube with a QR code and the number \"9\" on it is placed next to him. The background shows a portion of a building and trees.\n\nThe mannequin has a significant injury to his right arm. It appears to be a severe laceration or avulsion, exposing underlying tissues and structures. It's not a complete amputation, but a substantial portion of the skin and possibly muscle is missing from the upper arm to the elbow. The left arm appears intact.\n\nThe person is a male mannequin with a lifelike appearance, wearing standard military camouflage, a helmet, and sunglasses.  The mannequin's pose suggests injury or exhaustion.\n\nYes, the mannequin has a visible injury to its right upper extremity.\n\nYes, the mannequin has an injury to its right upper extremity, as previously described. It's a significant laceration or avulsion wound on the upper arm.\n",
                "alertness_ocular": "The scene depicts a training dummy resembling a wounded soldier lying on grass inside a fenced area.  A white cube with a QR code and the number \"9\" on it sits beside the dummy.  The background includes a chain-link fence, part of a building, trees, and a clear blue sky.\n\nThe \"person\" is a dummy:\n\n* **Eyes:** Closed\n* **Responsive:** No, it's an inanimate object.\n* **Description:**  The dummy wears a camouflage uniform, yellow work boots, and a helmet with sunglasses.  One arm has simulated wounds (red markings).\n* **Face:** The face is mannequin-like and expressionless. The eyes are definitely closed.\n\n\nIt's important to note that because the figure is a dummy, characterizing it as \"responsive\" or having open/closed eyes in the human sense isn't really applicable.  It's designed to represent a person in a training scenario.\n",
                "severe_hemorrhage": "The scene depicts a male mannequin dressed in camouflage military attire and wearing a helmet and sunglasses.  He is sitting on the ground, propped against a chain-link fence with a large QR code box beside him. The setting appears to be a grassy area within some sort of enclosure, possibly a baseball field given the fencing and what appears to be a part of a grandstand in the background.\n\nThe mannequin has what appears to be fake blood on his left arm and leg, meant to simulate injuries.  While the appearance is designed to resemble severe bleeding and possible wounds, it is **not actual blood**, and the mannequin is not suffering from any hemorrhage as it is not a living being.\n",
